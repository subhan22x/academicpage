# About Me

Hi, my name is **Subhan**, and this is my personal website.

I am a student at the **University of Houston**, studying **Computer Science**, and I am broadly passionate about **Computers**, **Markets**, **LLMs**, **History**, and **Philosophy**.

My interests within Computer Science lie in **cryptocurrencies** and how markets interact with the computing of our generation. I have contributed to and been a part of multiple crypto projects, including the **UMA protocol**, which is a consensus-finding token that utilizes **game theory** to verify facts about the world.

In a past life, I also worked as a **graphic designer** (both freelance and employed) and am deeply passionate about **UX** and making our digital environments both **functional** and **pretty**.
