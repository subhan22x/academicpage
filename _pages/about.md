Hi, my name is Subhan and this is my personal website. 

I am a student at the University of Houston studying Computer Science and am interested and broadly passionate about Computers, Markets, LLMs, History and Philosophy. 
My interests within CS lie within cryptocurrencies and how markets interact with computing of our generation. 
I have contributed to and been a part of multiple crypto projects including UMA protocol which is a consensus finding token that utilizes game theory to verify facts about the world. 
In a past life I have also worked as a graphic designer (both freelance and with employed) and am deeply passionate about UX and making our digital environments functional and pretty.
